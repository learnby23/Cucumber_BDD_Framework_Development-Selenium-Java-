Assert class in org.junit or org.testNG

The Assert are used to put the verfication point in selenium test scripts.
There are two types of asserts 1]Hard Assert(Assert) and 2]Soft Assert(verify)

Hard Assert:
If the Assert condition gets failed then it will not execute the remaining steps and get out of the loop.
No need to create the object of the Assert class.

Soft Assert:
If the Assert condition gets failed then it will execute the remaining steps also.
We need to create the object of the Soft Assert class.
*[IMP] at last compulsory we need to provide the assertAll() method then only it will print the error.
